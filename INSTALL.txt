####### How to use configure this program ########

When running the the start_inserter.bat file for the first time you will have to take some steps:

- when there is no mkmConnectorConfig.properties present the setup process will start, enter the values provided by the
MagickartenMarkt Profile information, enter dummy values for the Sandbox values if you do not plan on using the MkmSandbox Server
(pure testing Server for development purposes) and enter false at the config Use Sandbox

- the install_cert_modified.bat file will be rewritten to fit your java installation. After the mkmConnector has finished, 
you need to run the install_cert_modified.bat with ADMIN rights in order to trust the certificate of MagicKartenMarkt. If you
do not do this, this program will not be able to establish a secure connection and will not work.

You are now good to go
